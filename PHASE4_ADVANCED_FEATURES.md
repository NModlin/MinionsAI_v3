# Initialize performance monitoring
cache = CacheManager(max_size=1000, default_ttl=3600)
monitor = PerformanceMonitor()
monitor.set_cache_manager(cache)

# Start monitoring
await monitor.start_monitoring()

# Get performance metrics
metrics = monitor.collect_metrics()
print(f"CPU: {metrics.cpu_usage}%, Memory: {metrics.memory_usage}%")
```

```python
from core.advanced.security import SecurityManager, UserRole

# Initialize security
security = SecurityManager()

# Create user
security.create_user(
    username="admin",
    email="admin@company.com", 
    password="SecurePassword123!",
    role=UserRole.ADMIN
)

# Authenticate
token = security.authenticate_user("admin", "SecurePassword123!")
```

### **Multi-Model Management**
```python
from core.advanced.models import ModelManager, ModelType, ModelCapability

# Initialize model manager
models = ModelManager()

# Register models
models.register_model(
    name="llama3:8b",
    model_type=ModelType.OLLAMA,
    capabilities=[ModelCapability.TEXT_GENERATION, ModelCapability.REASONING]
)

# Get best model for task
best_model = models.get_best_model_for_task(
    "code_generation",
    required_capabilities=[ModelCapability.CODE_GENERATION]
)
```

### **Advanced Tools**
```python
from core.advanced.tools import AdvancedToolManager
